API DOCUMENTATION:
    
    I initialized this project using npm init command,after that I installed all required packages to complete project i.e.. sqlite3,sqlite,jsonwebtoken,bcrypt etc...
    after that I wrote api requests for registeration and login.If user register with existing user name then user gets response "USER ALREADY EXIST" else "USER REGISTERED SUCCEESSFULLY".
    If user login without registering then user gets response like "PLEASE LOGIN" else after successful login user gets response JWT TOKEN.After getting JWT TOKEN user makes api requsets using 
    token,If suppose user makes api requests without JWT TOKEN then user doesn't get expected response it returns "PROVIDE TOKEN". Here I made all api requests using THUNDER CLIENT Extension..
    * GET request is used to make get data.
    * PUT request is used to upadte existing data.
    * POST request is used to create new data.
    * DELETE request is used to delete existing data.

              with an easy way to deploy web applications, databases, static sites, and other services.
